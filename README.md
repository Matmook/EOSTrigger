# EOSTrigger
Simple Linux QT Application uses to control, trigger and download images from a Canon EOS camera (tested on 350D and 400D).

Available settings:
- iso
- exposure
- loop mode
- mirror lock feature
- automatic picture naming (dark, raw, ...)

The trigger function is handled by an external binary (usb_trigger) which currently control an uart's DTR line.
